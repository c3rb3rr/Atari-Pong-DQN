# Atari-Pong-DQN

This project was completed as part of a Machine Learning course. I replicated the DQN (Deep Q-Network) algorithm and trained a model to play the game Pong available in the Gym library.

## Requirements

The project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- Python 3.9
- `gym` version 0.19

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

- **Plots**: This directory contains plots of the model's learning progress after 5, 50, and 250 games.
- **Models**: This directory contains the trained and saved models.
